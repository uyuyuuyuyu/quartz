## 2. Matrices and Walks (§2.4)

### Adjacency Matrix Definition
Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V(G) = \{v_1, ..., v_n\}$. The **adjacency matrix** of $G$ is the $n \times n$ matrix $A = [a_{ij}]$ such that:

$$
a_{ij} = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } v_i v_j \in E(G) \\ 
0 & \text{else} 
\end{cases}
$$ 

**Example (The "Paw" Graph):**
* Vertices: 1, 2, 3, 4
* Edges form a triangle (1-2-3) with a pendant vertex (4) attached to 3.
* Matrix form:
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$ 

**Observations:**
1.  The matrix is **symmetric** ($a_{ij} = a_{ji}$).
2.  The **main diagonal** contains all 0s (no loops).
3.  The sum of a row (or column) equals the **degree** of that vertex ($d(v_i)$).

### Counting Walks (Theorem 2.13)
Now consider the adjacency matrix squared, $A^2 = [a_{ij}^{(2)}]$.
* Matrix multiplication rule: $a_{ij}^{(2)} = (\text{row } i \text{ of } A) \cdot (\text{col } j \text{ of } A) = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}a_{kj}$.
* The term $a_{ik}a_{kj}$ is 1 if and only if there is a walk $v_i \to v_k \to v_j$.
* Thus, $a_{ij}^{(2)}$ counts the number of walks of length 2 between $v_i$ and $v_j$.

**Theorem 2.13:** Let $G$ be a graph with vertices $v_1, ..., v_n$ and adjacency matrix $A$. Let $A^k = [a_{ij}^{(k)}]$. Then $a_{ij}^{(k)}$ gives the number of $v_i-v_j$ walks of length $k$ .

**Proof (by Induction on $k$):**
1.  **Base Case ($k=1$):** $A^1 = A$. $a_{ij} = 1$ if there is an edge (walk of length 1), 0 otherwise. This holds.
2.  **Inductive Step:** Suppose the theorem holds for powers $< k$.
    * Consider $A^k = A^{k-1} \cdot A$.
    * $a_{ij}^{(k)} = (\text{row } i \text{ of } A^{k-1}) \cdot (\text{col } j \text{ of } A)$
    * $a_{ij}^{(k)} = \sum_{l=1}^n a_{il}^{(k-1)} a_{lj}$.
    * $a_{il}^{(k-1)}$ is the number of walks of length $k-1$ from $v_i$ to $v_l$.
    * $a_{lj}$ is 1 if there is an edge $v_l v_j$, else 0.
    * Summing these gives the total number of walks of length $k$ ending at $v_j$ (by extending length $k-1$ walks by one edge) . $\square$

**Note:** In this context, walks are viewed as strings of vertices, so $v_1v_2 \neq v_2v_1$ (direction/order matters in the count).

## 3. Bridges (§4.1)

### Definitions and Notation
* Let $G = (V, E)$ and $e \in E$.
* **Notation:** $G-e$ is the graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E \setminus \{e\}$.
* **Definition:** An edge $e$ in a graph $G$ is a **bridge** if $G-e$ has more components than $G$.

### Bridge Characterization
**Theorem:** An edge $e$ of a graph $G$ is a bridge if and only if $e$ lies on **no cycle** of $G$ .

**Proof:**
1.  **($\Rightarrow$) Bridge $\implies$ No Cycle:**
    * Suppose $e = xy$ is a bridge.
    * Removing $e$ disconnects $x$ and $y$ (they are in different components of $G-e$).
    * If $e$ were on a cycle, there would be an alternative path between $x$ and $y$ in $G-e$.
    * Since no such path exists, $e$ cannot be on a cycle .
2.  **($\Leftarrow$) No Cycle $\implies$ Bridge:**
    * Suppose $e = xy$ is not a bridge.
    * Then $G-e$ is connected (assuming $G$ was connected), so there exists a path $P$ in $G-e$ from $x$ to $y$.
    * $P + e$ forms a cycle containing $e$.
    * Thus, if $e$ is on no cycle, it must be a bridge . $\square$

### Component Observation
**Observation:** Removing a bridge turns one component into precisely two components.
* **Proof:** Let $e = xy$ be a bridge. $G-e$ is disconnected. Let $G_x$ and $G_y$ be the components containing $x$ and $y$ respectively.
* For any vertex $v$, since $G$ was connected, there was a path from $v$ to $y$. If the path didn't use $e$, $v \in G_y$. If it did use $e$, the path went through $x$, so $v$ is connected to $x$ in $G-e$ (i.e., $v \in G_x$).
* Therefore, every vertex is in either $G_x$ or $G_y$. There are exactly two components .

### Multiplicity and Cycles
**Observation:** If a closed walk contains some edge $e$ with **odd multiplicity**, then the walk contains a cycle as a subgraph.
* **Proof:** Let $W$ be the closed walk. Let $G'$ be the subgraph of edges/vertices in $W$.
* If $G'$ has no cycle, it is a forest, so every edge is a bridge.
* Removing a bridge splits a component into two.
* Since $W$ is closed, it must traverse the bridge back and forth to return to the starting component.
* Therefore, every bridge must be traversed an even number of times.
* If an edge has odd multiplicity, $G'$ cannot be a forest, so it must contain a cycle .

*Note:* The converse is false. A closed walk can contain a cycle without having an edge of odd multiplicity (e.g., going around a cycle twice: $abcabca$) .

## 4. Trees (§4.2)

### Definitions
* **Forest:** A graph with no cycles ("acyclic").
* **Tree:** A connected graph with no cycles (a connected forest) .

### Unique Path Theorem (Thm 4.2.1)
A graph is a tree if and only if every pair of vertices is connected by a **unique path** .
* **Proof Idea:**
    * If no path $\implies$ Disconnected (not a tree).
    * If multiple paths $\implies$ The union of two distinct paths forms a closed walk, which contains a cycle $\implies$ Not a tree .

### Properties of Trees
**Theorem 4.3 (Leaves):** Every nontrivial tree (at least 1 edge) has at least **two leaves**.
* *Definition:* Leaf = vertex of degree 1. Inner vertex = degree $\ge 2$.
* **Proof:** Let $P$ be a longest path in tree $T$ with endpoints $u, v$.
    * All neighbors of $u$ must be on $P$ (otherwise $P$ could be extended).
    * Since $T$ is acyclic, $u$ cannot be connected to any other vertex on $P$ except its immediate neighbor.
    * Therefore, $d(u) = 1$. By symmetry, $d(v) = 1$. Thus, at least two leaves .

**Theorem 4.4 (Edge Count):** Every $n$-vertex tree has $n-1$ edges ($||T|| = n-1$).
* **Proof (Induction on $n$):**
    * **Base:** $n=1$, edges $= 0$. Holds.
    * **Step:** Let $T$ be an $n$-vertex tree. By Thm 4.3, it has a leaf $v$.
    * Remove $v$: $T-v$ is still connected and acyclic (a tree) with $n-1$ vertices.
    * By IH, $||T-v|| = (n-1) - 1 = n-2$.
    * Adding $v$ back adds exactly 1 edge. Total edges $= n-2+1 = n-1$ .

**Corollary 4.6:** Every $k$-component forest has $n-k$ edges.

### Minimum Connectivity
**Theorem 4.7:** If $G$ is a connected graph, then $||G|| \ge |G| - 1$.
* **Proof (Induction):**
    * We show that a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $n-1$ edges is "minimally connected" (every edge is a bridge, i.e., it is a tree).
    * If edges $< n-1$, it must be disconnected .

### Equivalent Properties (Theorem 4.8)
Consider the following three properties for a graph $G$:
1.  **($P_1$)** $G$ is connected.
2.  **($P_2$)** $G$ is acyclic.
3.  **($P_3$)** $||G|| = |G| - 1$.

**Theorem:** Any graph satisfying **2** of these properties automatically satisfies the **3rd** .
* **Summary (TFAE - The Following Are Equivalent):**
    1.  $T$ is a tree ($P_1 + P_2$).
    2.  Any two vertices are connected by a unique path.
    3.  $T$ is connected and $||T|| = |T|-1$ ($P_1 + P_3$).
    4.  $T$ is acyclic and $||T|| = |T|-1$ ($P_2 + P_3$) .

### Application: Alkanes
* Chemical formula: $C_n H_{2n+2}$.
* Graph interpretation:
    * Total vertices (Atoms) $= n + (2n+2) = 3n+2$.
    * Valency: Carbon has degree 4, Hydrogen has degree 1.
    * Sum of degrees $= 4n + 1(2n+2) = 6n+2$.
    * Number of edges $||A|| = \frac{1}{2} \sum \text{deg} = 3n+1$.
* Observe that $||A|| = (3n+2) - 1 = |A| - 1$.
* Since molecules are connected ($P_1$) and satisfy $|E| = |V|-1$ ($P_3$), they must be **acyclic** ($P_2$).
* Conclusion: Alkanes contain no cycles and no double bonds .

## 5. Additional Lemmas
* **Vertex Ordering Lemma:** The vertices of a nontrivial tree can be ordered $v_1, ..., v_n$ such that for every $i \ge 2$, $v_i$ has precisely one neighbor of lower index (in $\{v_1, ..., v_{i-1}\}$) .
* **Tree Subgraph (Fragmented):** There is a theorem stating that if $\delta(G) \ge k-1$ (approx), a tree of order $k$ is a subgraph of $G$ . *[Note: The text cuts off here]*
